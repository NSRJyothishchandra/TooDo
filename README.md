# TooDo is simple Mvvm Wpf Application.
i used SQlLite database in this project which is completely new to me it was a greate experience.
used a library called Dapper and prism.
prism is used for these types of projects "MVVM" and Event aggregation.
Dapper allows you to execute database queries and commands.
